In this final project, there was everything that was taught in the course. It consists of the function overloading,
class inheritance, operator functions, abstract class, virtual functions, pure virtual functions, file handling, how
to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory. The project was divided into 5 milestones, in every milestone, there was
a new concept including all the previous concepts. Overall the project was a good exercise to revise everything from
the course. In ms5 there was a final class PreTriage which had a lineup where the data of every patient was stored
whether it was from standard input(cin) or a .csv file. Then it calculates and prints the average waiting time
for the patients and at the end of the program stores the registered patients in the data file. Other than that there
was also an admit option, which admits the patient from the lineup, by printing the patient to standard output(cout)
and deleting that patient from the lineup using the provided function (removeDynamicElement()). I faced some issues
before as I was using the temporary objects on static memory, but later with the help of dynamic memory allocation,
the problem was solved. Overall, the project helped me to learn new things and also helped to know how to implement
the knowledge that have been taught in the course.
